# About Spider
Spider is a Discord bot admin tool for monitoring, controlling, and micromanaging your Discord bot user. It provides a terminal-like interface for executing commands on your bot user that can interact with Discord guilds, users and the rest of the API. It is written in Node.js using Electron and Discord.js.

I haven't added any sort of packaging tool, so to run it, you have to have Node.js+NPM and Electron installed (you can get Electron by running ``npm i -g electron``). Once that finishes, either run ``electron .`` or ``npm run start`` to run Spider.
